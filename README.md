# Clau's Kitchen: My mom's tool to share what she loves most 👩🏻‍🍳
This is a mini webdev project where I am applying what I learned about Astro, CSS, and HTML during my Cardinal Quarter experience.
I made this webpage for my mom because she loves cooking and sharing her recipes with family and friends. 


First of all, I started this project with a minimal Astro template.
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal

I made use of AI as a tutor, using Copilot and ChatGPT-4.
This static webpage taught me a lot, and I am pleased with the result!
