# Clau's Kitchen: My mom's tool to share what she loves most
This is a mini webdev project where I am applying what I learned about Astro, CSS, and HTML. 
I made this webpage for my mom because she loves cooking and sharing her recipes with family and friends. 

First of all, I started this project with a minimal astro template.
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal


## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
